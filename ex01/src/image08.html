        Jogging
        Jogging is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace. The main intention is to increase
        physical fitness with less stress on the body than from faster running but more than walking, or to maintain
        a steady speed for longer periods of time. Performed over long distances, it is a form of aerobic endurance
        training.

        Jogging is running at a gentle pace, its definition, as compared with running, is not standard. One
        definition describes jogging as running slower than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h). Running is sometimes defined
        as requiring a moment of no contact to the ground, whereas jogging often sustains the contact.
